5. Mini-Project 2: Weather Alert Bot

Use OpenWeatherMap API (free, needs signup key).

Fetch current weather for a city.

Print "Sydney: 22°C, Clear sky".

Stretch: If rain is expected, print "Bring umbrella ☔".

6. Mini-Project 3: Betfair API Intro (optional sneak peek 🐎)

Betfair offers an API (requires auth key).
